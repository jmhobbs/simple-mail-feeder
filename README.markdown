# What?
Simple Mail Feeder, or SMF, is a Python tool to feed RSS to your e-mail (or actually to lots of e-mails).  It's simple and unobtrusive.

# Why
I personally need it.

I love existing solutions like [feedmyinbox](http://www.feedmyinbox.com/pricing/) but I **don't** want to pay for something this basic (I know, I'm cheap) and I **do** need better than once a day updates.

[RSSFwd](http://rssfwd.wordpress.com/) was a good option, but they couldn't afford to run it for everyone. This way everyone can have speedy delivery and just use their own resources.
